# Loan Status Prediction using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the **loan approval status** of applicants based on historical loan data. The system assists financial institutions in making data-driven decisions, reducing manual verification, and minimizing credit risks by identifying potentially defaulting applicants early.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected.
- Enhance the speed and accuracy of loan processing.
- Provide interpretable predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
- Deploy the model through an interactive user interface built with Streamlit.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn` (Model building)
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (Data visualization)
  - `pandas`, `numpy` (Data manipulation)
- **Platform for Training**: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- **Deployment**: Streamlit
- **Environment Manager**: Anaconda Navigator
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

```
streamlit run app.py
```
